With extensive experience in all project phases, including estimation, planning, and execution, I have honed my skills in SAP application management, agile methodologies, and release management. My expertise lies in business process analysis, blueprint creation, and the development of functional specifications, SOPs, and user manuals. I have a proven track record in evaluating and improving HCM processes, collaborating with HR stakeholders to understand their needs, and delivering tailored solutions. My ability to foster relationships and manage diverse teams across multiple countries has been demonstrated through successful project outcomes. Additionally, I have designed and implemented automation test scripts for SAP HCM, executed test plans, and gained proficiency in QC ALM. My experience extends to SAP GRC implementation, with a focus on risk analysis, role management, and emergency access. As a SAP Certified Application Associate, I have effectively managed data migration projects and configured foundational objects and MDF within SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, enhancing position management and reporting capabilities.
